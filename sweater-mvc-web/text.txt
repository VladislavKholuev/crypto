Classical Algebra
 work at the close of the 16th century, described in the section
 and the formal equation, marks the start of the classical discipline 
of algebra. Further developments included several related trends, among which
 the following deserve special mention: the quest for systematic solutions of 
higher order equations, including approximation techniques; the rise of polynomials
 and their study as autonomous mathematical entities; and the increased adoption of
 the algebraic perspective in other mathematical disciplines, such as geometry, analysis,
 and logic. During this same period, new mathematical objects arose that eventually replaced
 polynomials as the main focus of algebraic study.


Analytic geometry
The creation of what came to be known as analytic geometry can be attributed to
 two great 17th-century French thinkers: Pierre de Fermat and Ren Descartes. Using 
algebraic techniques developed by Vi??te and Girolamo Cardano, as described earlier in 
this article, Fermat and Descartes tackled geometric problems that had remained unsolved
 since the time of the classical Greeks. The new kind of organic connection that they 
established between algebra and geometry was a major breakthrough, without which the
 subsequent development of mathematics in general, and geometry and calculus in particular,
 would be unthinkable.

In his famous book La  (1637), Descartes established equivalences between 
algebraic operations and geometric constructions. In order to do so, he introduced a
 unit length that served as a reference for all other lengths and for all operations
 among them. For example, suppose that Descartes was given a segment AB and was asked
 to find its square root. He would draw the straight line DB (see the figure), where DA 
was defined as the unit length. Then he would bisect DB at C, draw the semicircle on the 
diameter DB with centre C, and finally draw the perpendicular from A to E on the semicircle. 
Elementary properties of the circle imply that DEB = 90 , which in turn implies that
ADE = AEB and DEA = EBA. Thus, DEA is similar to EBA, or in other words, the ratio 
of corresponding sides is equal. Substituting x, 1, and y for AB, DA, and AE, respectively,
 one obtains x/y = y/1. Simplifying, x = y2, or y is the square root of x. Thus, in what might
 appear to be an ordinary application of classical Greek techniques, Descartes demonstrated
that he could find the square root of any given number, as represented by a line segment. The
 key step in his construction was the introduction of the unit length DA. This seemingly 
trivial move, or anything similar to it, had never been done before, and it had enormous 
repercussions for what could thereafter be done by applying algebraic reasoning to geometry.

 polynomials as the main focus of algebraic study.


Analytic geometry
The creation of what came to be known as analytic geometry can be attributed to
 two great 17th-century French thinkers: Pierre de Fermat and Ren Descartes. Using 
algebraic techniques developed by Vi??te and Girolamo Cardano, as described earlier in 
this article, Fermat and Descartes tackled geometric problems that had remained unsolved
 since the time of the classical Greeks. The new kind of organic connection that they 
established between algebra and geometry was a major breakthrough, without which the
 subsequent development of mathematics in general, and geometry and calculus in particular,
 would be unthinkable.

In his famous book La  (1637), Descartes established equivalences between 
algebraic operations and geometric constructions. In order to do so, he introduced a
 unit length that served as a reference for all other lengths and for all operations
 among them. For example, suppose that Descartes was given a segment AB and was asked
 to find its square root. He would draw the straight line DB (see the figure), where DA 
was defined as the unit length. Then he would bisect DB at C, draw the semicircle on the 
diameter DB with centre C, and finally draw the perpendicular from A to E on the semicircle. 
Elementary properties of the circle imply that DEB = 90 , which in turn implies that
ADE = AEB and DEA = EBA. Thus, DEA is similar to EBA, or in other words, the ratio 
of corresponding sides is equal. Substituting x, 1, and y for AB, DA, and AE, respectively,
 one obtains x/y = y/1. Simplifying, x = y2, or y is the square root of x. Thus, in what might
 appear to be an ordinary application of classical Greek techniques, Descartes demonstrated
that he could find the square root of any given number, as represented by a line segment. The
 key step in his construction was the introduction of the unit length DA. This seemingly 
trivial move, or anything similar to it, had never been done before, and it had enormous 
repercussions for what could thereafter be done by applying algebraic reasoning to geometry.
Classical Algebra
 work at the close of the 16th century, described in the section
 and the formal equation, marks the start of the classical discipline 
of algebra. Further developments included several related trends, among which
 the following deserve special mention: the quest for systematic solutions of 
higher order equations, including approximation techniques; the rise of polynomials
 and their study as autonomous mathematical entities; and the increased adoption of
 the algebraic perspective in other mathematical disciplines, such as geometry, analysis,
 and logic. During this same period, new mathematical objects arose that eventually replaced
 polynomials as the main focus of algebraic study.
